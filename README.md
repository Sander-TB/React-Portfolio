# React App Personal Portfolio

I am building my personal portfolio website using create-react-app and Tailwindcss.

This is my 4th iteration of the design, hopefully this will be the one I stick with.

To install dependencies:

```bash
yarn

# or

npm install
```

To run app:

```bash
craco start
```
